### Technical Details

FEniCS has a C++ interface, called DOLFIN, and wrappers in pybind11 for a Python interface.
PETSc and Trilinos support complex numbers.

### Open Source Development Experience

This project requires knowledge of C++ and Python.

### First steps

Install FEniCS from https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/dolfin and try out the demos.
Install [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org) and view the output from the FEniCS demos.
The FEniCS tutorial at https://fenicsproject.org/tutorial/
has an up-to-date description of using FEniCS to solve partial differential equations.

### Open Source Development Experience

This project requires knowledge of C++ and Python, and will require working with multiple git repositories
and different teams with FEniCS developers. Some knowledge of finite element methods would also be desirable,
but not necessary. Those who are interested compiler technology might also find this project suitable.

### First steps

Install FEniCS from https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/dolfin and try out the demos. The FEniCS book
https://fenicsproject.org/pub/book/book/fenics-book-2011-06-14.pdf (GNU Free Doc License) contains a
description of the form compiler technology behind FEniCS. The FEniCS tutorial at
https://fenicsproject.org/tutorial/ has an up-to-date description of using FEniCS to solve partial
differential equations.
